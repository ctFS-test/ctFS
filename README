This version of the code still needs polishing. It's not the final version yet. 
You can find the user components in ctU, and the most interesting part is ctfs_format.h, 
where the hierarchical layout is defined, and ctfs_pgg.c, where the layout is implemented.

The kernel components are in ctK, to replace the corresponding files under drivers/dax/ of Linux kernel v5.7.0-rc7+
